APPENDIX 1:
Any IPA / iOS Application signing service like appdb, TweakBox, AppValley, 
Tutu or such is prohibited from uploading this application and serving it through their service.
Also, bundling this application with any advertisement platform by these services is also prohibited.
This is to prevent malware from being bundled with a legitimate jailbreak. Jailbreak tools use exploits 
capable of disabling system security and can be dangerous if they're not taken from a trusted source,
which in my opinion, these signing services are not.
